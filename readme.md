# Hangman (due 3/24/23)

Create a program that simulates a game of Hangman. The program should randomly select a word from a list and then prompt the user to guess letters in the word. The user should have a limited number of guesses before the game ends.

```
def hangman():
  
  # 1. Create a wordbank with a list of strings
  wordbank = []

  # 2. Randomly select a word from the word bank for each new game

  # 3. Optionally - Create an object with underscores to display the letters of the word

  # 4. Ask the user to guess a letter

  # 5. Check if the letter guessed is in the word

  # 6. Create rules for if guess is incorrect

  # 7. Create rules for if the guess is correct
