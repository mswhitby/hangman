# Hangman (due 3/24/23)

Create a program that simulates a game of Hangman. The program should randomly select a word from a list and then prompt the user to guess letters in the word. The user should have a limited number of guesses before the game ends.

```
import random

def hangman():

  # 1. Create a wordbank using a list of strings
  wordbank = []

  # 2. Randomly select a target word from the list for each new game.
  # Hint use random.choice() from the random module
  word = ...

  # 3. Ask the user to guess a letter
  # Hint: You'll need to use input()

  # 4. Check if the letter is in the word

  # 5. Create rules for if the letter is not in the word

  # 6. Create rules for if the letter is in the word
  ```
