# Hangman (due 3/24/23)

Create a program that simulates a game of Hangman. The program should randomly select a word from a list and then prompt the user to guess letters in the word. The user should have a limited number of guesses before the game ends.

```
  def hangman():

  # 1. Create a list of strings that will comprise your wordbank.
  wordbank = []

  # 2. Randomly select a word from your wordbank
  # Hint: Figure out how to randomly select in element of a list in python

  # 3. Limit the number of guesses
  # Hint: Create a variable to count the number of guesses

  # 4. Ask the user to guess a letter
  # Hint: Use the input function, and include instructions for the user

  # 5. Check if the user's letter is in the word

  # 6. Create rules for if the user guesses correctly

  # 7. Create rules for if the user guesses incorrectly
